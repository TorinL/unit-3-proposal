  Our app will connect to the google translate api to provide users with the ability to look up and translate phrases from english to a language of their choice. It will also be able to detect the language and translate to english. Users will find this app useful for when they plan international travel.

  User information entered will be stored and users will be able to see a list of the most common phrases and languages input by other users.

  Users will need to make an account in order to input new phrases but will be able to view most popular phrases without an account.
